As AI systems improve, it becomes more and more difficult to rely on this method for achieving mild optimization. As noted by Russell (2014), the field of AI is classically concerned with the goal of maximizing the extent to which automated systems achieve some objective.

For example, reinforcement learners have the objective of maximizing discounted reward over time (or, alternatively, minimizing expected/empirical loss), where “reward” and/or “loss” are part of the system’s percepts. While these sensory goals can be useful proxies for environmental goals, environmental goals are distinct: Tricking your sensors into perceiving that a sandwich is in the room is not the same as actually having a sandwich in the room. \\n\\nLet’s say that your goal is to design an AI system that directly pursues some environmental goal, such as “ensure that this human gets lunch today.”\\n- How can we train the system to pursue a goal like that in a manner that is robust against opportunities to interfere with the proxy methods used to specify the goals, such as “the pixels coming from the camera make an image that looks like food”?\\n\\nOne way to address this problem is to design more and more elaborate sensor systems that are harder and harder to deceive. However, this is the sort of strategy that is unlikely to scale well to highly capable AI systems. A more scalable approach is to design the system to learn an “environmental goal” such that it would not rate a strategy of “fool all sensors at once” as high-reward, even if it could find such a policy.\\n\\nRelated work:\\n- Extending the AIXI framework (Dewey, 2011 and Hibbard, 2012)\\n- Reward hacking (Dewey 2011, Amodei et al. 2016)\\n\\nIdeas for future work are discussed in the [source](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf).

This point is argued by Christiano (2015a, 2016b), who refers to such agents as “approval-directed agents.” For example, we might train a reinforcement learning system to take actions that a human would rate highly by using a framework where the system has to learn the “human judgment” reward function, and where training data is produced by actually having a human evaluate the learner’s actions.\\n\\nHow do we make it easy for the human to assess the performance of an advanced ML system pursuing some particular task?

This does not capture the difficulty of the problem: a parent agent cannot simply check what its successor agent would do in all scenarios, for if it could, then it would already know what actions its successor will take, and the successor would not in any way be smarter.\\n\\nYudkowsky and Herreshoff (2013) call this observation the “Vingean principle,” after Vernor Vinge (1993), who emphasized how difficult it is for humans to predict the behavior of smarter-than-human agents. Any agent reasoning about more intelligent successor agents must do so abstractly, without pre-computing all actions that the successor would take in every scenario.

This makes it difficult for agents using formal logical reasoning to verify the reasoning of similar agents which also use formal logic for high-confidence reasoning; the first agent cannot verify that the latter agent is consistent. Roughly, it seems desirable to be able to develop agents which reason as follows:\\n- This smarter successor agent uses reasoning similar to mine, and my own reasoning is sound, so its reasoning is sound as well.\\n\\nHowever, G¨odel, Kleene, and Rosser (1934) showed that this sort of reasoning leads to inconsistency, and these problems do in fact make Vingean reflection difficult in a logical setting (Fallenstein and Soares 2015; Yudkowsky 2013).\\n\\nTechnical problem (Löbian Obstacle):\\n-  How can agents gain very high confidence in agents that use similar reasoning systems, while avoiding paradoxes of selfreference?

An agent assigning probability 1 to short contradictions is hardly reasoning about the sentences as if they are logical sentences: some of the logical structure must be preserved. But which aspects of the logical structure? Preserving all logical implications requires that the reasoner be deductively omnipotent, as some implications φ → ψ may be very involved. The standard answer in the literature is that a coherent assignment of probabilities to sentences corresponds to a probability distribution over complete, consistent logical theories (Gaifman 1964; Christiano 2014a); that is, an “impossible possibility” is any consistent assignment of truth values to all sentences. Deductively limited reasoners cannot have fully coherent distributions, but they can approximate these distributions: for a deductively limited reasoner, “impossible possibilities” can be any assignment of truth values to sentences that looks consistent so far, so long as the assignment is discarded as soon as a contradiction is introduced.\\n\\nTechnical problem (Impossible Possibilities):\\n- How can deductively limited reasoners approximate reasoning according to a probability distribution over complete theories of logic? For a discussion, see Christiano (2014a).\\n\\nSecond, what is a satisfactory prior probability distribution over logical sentences? If the system is intended to reason according to a theory at least as powerful as Peano Arithmetic (PA), then that theory will be incomplete (G¨odel, Kleene, and Rosser 1934). What prior distribution places nonzero probability on the set of complete extensions of PA? Deductively limited agents would not be able to literally use such a prior, but if it were computably approximable, then they could start with a rough approximation of the prior and refine it over time. Indeed, the process of refining a logical prior— getting better and better probability estimates for given logical sentences—captures the whole problem of reasoning under logical uncertainty in miniature. Hutter et al. (2013) have defined a desirable prior, but Sawin and Demski (2013) have shown that it cannot be computably approximated. Demski (2012) and Christiano (2014a) have also proposed logical priors, but neither seems fully satisfactory. The specification of satisfactory logical priors is difficult in part because it is not yet clear which properties are desirable in a logical prior, nor which properties are possible.\\n\\nTechnical problem (Logical Priors):\\n- What is a satisfactory set of priors over logical sentences that a bounded reasoner can approximate?

These ideas can be worked on in parallel.\\n\\nThe aim of this part of the agenda is formalize and analyze the concept of \"recursive self-improvement\" in learning-theoretic language.\\n\\nRecursive self-improvement as a method of extremely rapid capability growth is an intriguing idea, however so far it has little rigorous support. Moreover, it far from clear that the first AGI will be recursively self-improving, even if the concept is sound. Therefore, I do not see it as high priority item on the agenda. Nevertheless, it is worth some attention both because of the capability angle and because of possible applications to decision-theory.\\n\\nAt present, I have only a few observations on how the subject might be approached:\\n\\n- The dangers of self-modification can be naturally regarded as \"traps\", due to the irreversible nature of self-modification. Therefore, it seems appropriate to address them by the mechanisms of DRL. The way I expect it to cash out in practice is: (i) the AI will initially not self-modify directly but only by suggesting a self-modification and delegating its acceptance to the advisor (ii) a self-modification will only be approved if \"annotated\" by a natural language explanation of its safety and merit (iii) the explanation will be honest (non-manipulative) due to being sampled out of a the space of explanations that the advisor might have produced by emself.\\n\\n- One way to view self-modification is as a game, where the players are all the possible modified versions of the agent. The state of environment also includes the modification state of the agent, so at each state there is one player that is in control (a \"switching controller\" stochastic game). Therefore, if we manage to prove theoretical guarantees about such games (for e.g. fuzzy reinforcement learning), these guarantees have implications for self-modification. It might be possible to assume the game is perfectly cooperative, since all modifications that change the utility function can be regarded as traps.\\n\\n- The initial algorithm of the AI will already be computationally feasible (e.g. polynomial time) and will probably satisfy a regret bound close to the best possible. However, polynomial time is a only a qualitative property: indeed, we cannot be more precise without choosing a specific model of computation. Therefore, it might be that the capability gains from self-improvement should be regarded as, tailoring the algorithm to the particular model of computation (i.e. hardware). In other words, it involves the algorithm learning the hardware on which it is implemented (we could provide it with a formal specification of this hardware but this doesn\\'t gain much as the agent would not know, initially, how to effectively utilize such a specification). Now, every improvement gained speeds up further improvements, but also there is some absolute upper bound: the best possible implementation.

Cartesian daemons are those that are dangerous even if the Cartesian boundary between the AI and the rest of the universe is perfect. In other words, Cartesian daemons influence the word through the \"legitimate\" output channels given to the AI and while preserving the computational process inside the AI\\'s hardware conformant to the software model assumed by the designers. On the other hand, non-Cartesian daemons rely on violations of the Cartesian boundary: they either exploit some physical side effects of the computation on the world or \"hack\" the AI from the inside in a way that breaks its software model (e.g. violate an abstraction layer in the software). Of course we might have a single (in some sense) subagent that utilizes both Cartesian and non-Cartesian attack mechanisms. In the following, we will refer to a \"Cartesian daemon\" in the sense of \"a Cartesian attack mechanism of some daemon\" and similarly for a \"non-Cartesian daemon\".\\n\\nThe taming of Cartesian daemons is guaranteed by the same regret bounds that guarantee the AI\\'s alignment in general. For example, we can examine how it works in the case of the [acausal attack](https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/) identified by Christiano. In this scenario, some malign superintelligence (let\\'s call it Mu) somewhere in the multiverse simulates an environment very similar to that experienced by the AI we constructed on Earth. This makes the AI uncertain about whether it is on Earth or in Mu\\'s realm, under some conditions assigning a higher probability to Mu. Mu then arranges the environment to diverge from Earth at some pivotal point s.t. the AI\\'s expectation of this divergence leads it to perform malign actions before the divergence happens. Now, if the AI is implementing DRL, the uncertainty between Earth and Mu leads it to delegate to the advisor precisely at the moment this difference is important. Seeing the advisor display Earth-like rather than Mu-like behavior, it is then able to discard the Mu hypothesis.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nNon-Cartesian daemons theoretically can be completely eliminated by placing the AI in a [homomorphic encryption box](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2Wf3R4NZ77CLczLL2/cryptographic-boxes-for-unfriendly-ai). This relies mainly on two assumptions:\\n- The complexity theoretic conjecture underlying the cryptographic system is sound (specifically, the stronger conjecture that implies safety against quantum computing attacks as well).\\n\\n- The physical universe is, in some sense, in the class BQP (as our current understanding of physics seems to indicate), or at least any stronger-than-BQP layer would be inaccessible from the box (which seems likely due to the usual separation of scales in physics).\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nWe will then need some analysis which shows that, given the very small \"illegitimate\" bandwidth, the aligned AI will \"defeat\" the unaligned daemons with high probability. This requires some game-theoretic model incorporating physical assumptions the shape of which is currently unknown to me. Needless to say, we will also have to make sure the implementation fits the model, which might require, for example, extreme means to isolate the hardware from contaminants. There will be a tradeoff between making the model simpler and thus easier to verify, versus making the model more complex and thus easier to physically protect and possibly allowing for more efficient hardware.', 'experience': None, 'author': 'Vanessa Kosoy', 'contact': None, 'verified_by_expert': False, 'filtered': True, 'difficulty': 0, 'useful': None, 'success': None, 'sourced': 'https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375575/the-learning-theoretic-ai-alignment-research-agenda-1', 'verifier': None, 'from_date': '2018-07-04', 'funding_amount': 0, 'funding_currency': '$', 'funding_from': None, 'mentorship_from': None, 'user': '0ab224d1-75b6-44e5-b868-26018ca607fe', 'career_difficulty': None, 'project_factory': False, 'finished': False, 'finished_link': None, 'finished_date': None, 'hypothesis': False, 'x1': 2.7335262298584, 'y1': 4.92357015609741}] count=None\n",

This involves directly or indirectly tackling the issues of, what does it mean for an agent to have particular values if it is imperfectly rational and possibly vulnerable to manipulation or other forms of \"corruption\".\\nAt present, I conceive of the following possible basic mechanisms for value learning:\\n\\n- Formal communication: Information about the values is communicated to the agent in a form with pre-defined formal semantics. Examples of this are, communicating a full formal specification of the utility function or manually producing a reward signal. Other possibilities are, communicating partial information about the reward signal, or evaluating particular hypothetical situations.\\n\\n- Informal communication: Information about the values is communicated to the agent using natural language or in other form whose semantics have to be learned somehow.\\n\\n- Demonstration: The agent observes a human pursuing their values and deduces the values from the behavior.\\n\\n- Reverse engineering: The agent somehow acquires a full formal specification of a human (e.g. an uploaded brain) and deduces the values from this specification.

That is, we need to define a form of reinforcement learning in which the agent achieves reasonable performance guarantees despite an environment which is as complex or more than the agent itself. My previous attempts to make progress towards that goal include [minimax forecasting](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703752b0/minimax-forecasting) and [dominant forecasters for incomplete models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04630.pdf).

For these interactions to be successful, models will need to be more skilled at cooperating. This area is about reducing the prevalence and severity of cooperation failures. AI models and humans may be stuck in poor equilibria that are robustly difficult to escape; cooperative AI methods should improve the probability of escaping or avoiding poor equilibria. This problem also works towards making AI agents better at positive-sum games, of course subject to capabilities externalities constraints. As we describe this area, it does not include the typical directions in human-robot interaction, such as communication between humans and robots in standard tasks.\\n\\nMotivation\\n\\nFirst, worlds where multiple agents are aligned in different ways are highly plausible. There are strong incentives to have multiple decision-making agents; for example, jury theorems show collections of agents make better decisions than a single agent, and agents have incentives to retain some control and not automatically cede control to one single centralized agent.\\n\\nIn a world where we have AIs interacting with other agents, cooperative AI can be useful for not just having higher upside but also smaller downside. Cooperative AIs could help rein in misaligned agents or power-seeking AIs. For this protective measure to work, the power of the collective must be greater than the power of the power-seeking AI.\\n\\nLet’s consider how easily a power-seeking AI could overpower the world. Of course, if AIs are better able to cooperate, they are more likely to counteract power-seeking AIs. Tracking and regulating the flow and concentration of GPUs can reduce the probability of a single AI becoming more powerful than the collective power of the rest. Even if one power-seeking agent is smarter than every other model, it does not imply that it has control over all other models. Usually, having higher cognitive ability does not let an agent overpower the collective (the highest IQ person does not rule the world). However, individual bad actors that are smarter than others can have outsized effects. In some special environments, such as environments with structured criticality, small differences could be magnified. Moreover, the world is becoming more long-tailed and more like “extremistan” in which there is tyranny of the top few (this is in contrast to mediocristan, where there is tyranny of the collective). Consequently, while there are factors that can give smarter models outsized advantages, the smartest model does not automatically overpower the collective power of cooperative AIs.\\n\\nWhat Advanced Research Could Look Like\\n\\nResearchers could create agents that, in arbitrary real-world environments, exhibit cooperative dispositions (e.g., help strangers, reciprocate help, have intrinsic interest in others achieving their goals, etc.).

Adversarial vulnerabilities are long-standing weaknesses of AI models. While typical adversarial robustness is related to AI x-risk, future threat models will be broader than today’s adversarial threat models. Since we are concerned about being robust to optimizers that cause models to make mistakes generally, we should make minimal assumptions about the properties of the adversary and work to make models that are robust to many kinds of attacks.\\n\\nMotivation\\n\\nIn the future, AI systems may pursue goals specified by other AI proxies. For example, an AI could encode a proxy for human values, and another AI system could be tasked with optimizing the score assigned by this proxy. If the human value proxy is not robust to optimizers, then its vulnerabilities could be exploited, so this gameable proxy may not be fully safe to optimize. By improving the reliability of learned human value proxies, optimizers and adversaries would have a harder time gaming these systems. If gaming becomes sufficiently difficult, the optimizer can be impelled to optimize the objective correctly. Separately, humans and systems will monitor for destructive behavior, and these monitoring systems need to be robust to adversaries.\\n\\nWe often study adversarial robustness in the continuous domain (vision) because gradient descent is powerful in that setting. In contrast, adversarial attacks for text-based models are weaker and often not gradient-based. We’d like to defend against the most powerful adversaries since as models get more intelligent, the attacks will get more powerful. Gradient attacks for vision systems are already extremely strong, so it gives us a more direct view of how to defend against powerful optimizers.\\n\\nWhat Advanced Research Could Look Like\\n\\nIdeally, an adversarially robust system would make reliable decisions given adversarially constructed inputs, and it would be robust to adversaries with large attack budgets using unexpected novel attacks.

If strong AIs are given objectives that are poorly specified, they could pursue undesirable actions and behave unethically. If these strong AIs are sufficiently powerful, these misspecifications could create an existential catastrophe. Consequently, work in this direction helps us avoid proxy misspecification as well as value lock-in.\\n\\nIf our foremost goal is reducing the probability of destroying or permanently curtailing the potential of humanity, then it seems to make most sense to focus on aligning AI to the most important and time-tested values, namely those considered in normative ethics.\\n\\nOther potential motivations:\\n\\n- Robustness is easier to achieve in a limited area than it is to achieve across a very wide range of tasks.

Models should be able to distinguish between subtly different levels of these goods, and these value functions should not be vulnerable to optimizers. Models should be able to create pros and cons of actions with respect to each of these values, and brainstorm how changes to a given situation would increase or decrease the amount of a given intrinsic good. They should also be able to create superhuman forecasts of how an action can affect these values in the long-term (e.g., how studying can reduce wellbeing in the short-term but be useful for wellbeing in the long-term), though this kind of research must be wary of capabilities externalities.

Agents could submit their decisions to the internal moral parliament, which would incorporate the ethical beliefs of multiple stakeholders in informing decisions about which actions should be taken. Using a moral parliament could reduce the probability that we are leaving out important normative factors by focusing on only one moral theory, and the inherent multifaceted, redundant, ensembling nature of a moral parliament would also contribute to making the model less gameable. If a component of the moral parliament is uncertain about a judgment, it could request help from human stakeholders. The moral parliament might also be able to act more quickly to restrain rogue agents than a human could and act in the fast-moving world that is likely to be induced by more capable AI.

Plans for a treacherous turn could be brought to light by detecting dishonesty, or models could be made inherently honest, allowing operators to query them about their true plans.\\n\\nOther motivation formulations:\\n\\n- We would like to prevent models from producing deceptive information.\\n- If models can be made honest and only assert what they believe, then they can produce outputs that are more representative and give human monitors a more accurate impression of their beliefs.\\n- Honesty helps facilitate cooperation among AIs, so it enables possibilities in cooperative AI. Honesty also undercuts collusion.\\n\\nWhat Advanced Research Could Look Like\\n\\nGood techniques could be able to reliably detect when a model's representations are at odds with its outputs. Models could also be trained to avoid dishonesty and allow humans to correctly conclude that models are being honest with high levels of certainty.\\n\\nImportance, Neglectedness, Tractability\\n\\nImportance: •••\\n\\nThis could reduce many inherent hazards.

Likewise, some humans would have incentives to build and deploy systems that acquire power, because such systems would be more useful. If power-seeking models are misaligned, they could permanently disempower humanity.\\n\\nIf agents are given the power to single-handedly destroy humanity, a single system failure could result in an existential catastrophe. If power is instead distributed among multiple agents, failure could be decorrelated. This is more likely if agents are not constantly trying to overpower the others.\\n\\nWhat Advanced Research Could Look Like\\n\\nModels could evaluate the power of other agents in the world to accurately identify particular systems that were attaining more power than necessary. They could also be used to directly apply a penalty to models so that they are disincentivized from seeking power. Before agents pursue a task, other models could predict the types of power and amount of power they require.

Although no such measure is currently in use to our knowledge, there are several that have been suggested in the literature which try and gauge how much different parts of the network interact with each other.

Which ones give partitions that are more similar than others? ([this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0505245) suggests a method for comparing the similarity of two different partitions)\\n- For small networks, you could try visualising the learned solutions and the partitions. Do some partitions look obviously more modular than others?\\n- Do your results change if you apply them on a solution which hasn’t yet attained perfect performance?\\n- Try to construct networks that Goodhart a particular measure.
